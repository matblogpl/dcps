    This is Simple Distributed Computing Pixel Shader mechanisms based on Java.

    Parts of this software include:

    - API (as of documentation)
    - API (as of software interfaces for external apps)
    - Distribution Server source
    - Computing Node source

    Documentation - aka. JavaDoc - can be found in /doc folder.
    License (MIT License) can be accessed by /LICENSE file.


    To bind this software with Your application, You need to provide Pixel Shader class, based on HPCPixelShader
    interface (provide implementation), load Your image into Java Object based on HPCBitmapModel and provide needed
    informations and then bind into server with Naming.lookup, like this:


    HPCBridge bridge = (HPCBridge) Naming.lookup("rmi://<server ip>:9090/hpcRmiNodeServer");


    Now You can use applyShaders method to apply Your new shader on Your image:


    HPCBitmap finalVersion = bridge.applyShaders(sourceImage, shadersArrayList);
